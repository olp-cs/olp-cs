👋 I'm a software engineer and researcher with experience in backend systems, R&D, data science, AI/ML, and NLP. 

🌍 I'm based in Italy 🇮🇹. Originally from Moldova 🇲🇩, I've spent some time in Spain 🇪🇸, Belgium 🇧🇪, and Poland 🇵🇱. I've been working in English with international teams since 2011, remotely since 2014.

💾 I started programming with BASIC and explored languages from Assembly to Prolog. These days, I mostly write in Python 🐍​.

🚀 I enjoy learning new things. Lately, I've been exploring AI and learning Rust 🦀.

💡 I'm also interested in open-source projects.
