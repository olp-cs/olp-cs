👋 I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience, specializing in backend development, AI, ML, NLP, data science, and complex algorithms.

🌍 I'm based in Italy 🇮🇹. Originally from Moldova 🇲🇩, I've spent some time in Spain 🇪🇸, Belgium 🇧🇪, and Poland 🇵🇱. I've been working in English with international teams since 2011, remotely since 2014.

💾 My programming journey started with BASIC, and I've explored languages ranging from Assembly to Prolog. These days, I mostly write in Python, but I'm always expanding my tooklit.

🚀 I’m always eager to learn something new. Currently, I'm diving deeper into AI and exploring Rust 🦀.

💡 I'm also interested in open source!
